# Sets are unordered collection of unique elements


myset = set()

# The sets are an unordered collection of data types. These are mutable, iterable, and do not consist of any duplicate elements. The set class in Python represents the setâ€™s mathematical notion.


myset.add(1)

myset.add(2)

myset.add(2) # It will print "2" just once - cannot have duplicates in sets

print(myset)
