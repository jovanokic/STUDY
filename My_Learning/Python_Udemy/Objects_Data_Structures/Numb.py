# Integers

    # hole numbers


# Floats

    # note whole numbers


# Both int and floats can do basic match functions


# Modular, good for checking odd or not

mod = 7 % 5 # 7 divided by 4 leaves one and remainder of 3

print(mod)


#Modular 2

mod_2 = 7 // 2 # how many times in 7

print(mod_2)


# Numbers and operations follow regular rules of math - can be used as calculator


# Check type

print(type(mod_2))
print(type(4.6))

my_income = 100

tax = 0.1

my_tax = my_income * tax
